**Requirements**                                    
    Install NodeJS and Express,Sequelize,body-parser,cors
    Ensure Mysql Server is Up
    Create Mysql Required Tables
    Postman or Similar Type of Application ( REST Client, HTTPie ..) will be needed to test our endpoints


**Overview of Node JS API Implementation?**                             
    Start With an Express Web Server.
    Add Configuration for MySQL Database
    Create Property Model
    Write the Controller
    Then Define Routes for Handling all CRUD operations
    Finally, go to test the Rest APIs using Postman



**Nodejs**                                                      
    Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

**Express js**                                                                                            
    Express.js, or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. 

**Sequelize**                                       
    Sequelize is a promise-based Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server. It features solid transaction support, relations, eager and lazy loading, read replication and more.


**body-parser**                                         
    body-parser Node.js body parsing middleware. Parse incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the req.body property.

**CORS**                                                    
    CORS is a node.js package for providing a Connect/Express middleware that can be used to enable CORS with various options.

**What is Postman?**                                                                      
    Postman is an application used for API testing. It is an HTTP client that tests HTTP requests, utilizing a graphical user interface, through which we obtain different types of responses that need to be subsequently validated.

**What is REST?**                                                                               
    REST (Representational State Transfer) is a software architectural style that developers established to assist in creating and developing the World Wide Webâ€™s architecture. REST specifies a set of criteria on how the architecture of an Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system, such as the Web, should operate. It is one of the various ways applications, servers, and websites may communicate data and services. It generally provides the rules for how developers working with data and services represent elements through the API. Other programs may appropriately request and receive the data and services that an API makes accessible.
